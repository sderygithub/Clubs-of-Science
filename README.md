### Abstract ###

The emergence of structure in interacting entities is a rich field of study and long been recognized as a defining characteristic of social networks. Indeed individuals are often seen to spontaneously form communities with internally dense links that are otherwise sparse externally, termed a small world network. Scientific communities are not an exception to this observation. Their study promises to form rich pictures of the social connection, impact and influence one node has on their peers, thus providing a framework for the formal analysis of their dynamics. We suggest that difficulties in obtaining large-scale and accurate data in a relevant format currently stand as a missing bridge to theories of social factors at play in scientific collaborations. This work proposes a novel way to obtain and analyze relevant data across scientific communities by focusing on two technical efforts: (i) a custom web-crawler that can navigate the Google Scholar academic search engine architecture to build social networks of coauthorship and (ii) a web interface for an interactive visualization of these graphs, enabling a meaningful representation for visitors to parse and explore. As a proof of concept and to study its reliability, we investigated the field of neuroimaging for which we had prior knowledge. Our results suggest the tool can reliably draw a portrait of key players of a specific scientific branch. The availability of this information in this format advances our ability to quantify the influence of certain factors in academia. It also promises to raise awareness and interest from the public through an openly available and interactive platform.
